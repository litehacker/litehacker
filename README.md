Hi!                  ðŸ‘‹

I'm a collection of Giorgi's repositories, named [litehacker](https://github.com/litehacker). Here are some old C/C++ repositories, made for assignment purposes, the most of them are latest projects [Giorgi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/litehacker/?_l=en_US) has a passion for.

## Who is Giorgi?

A computer engineer who loves music, playing some instruments, blogger on [MaggyPrint.com](https://maggyprint.com). Related projects are called [MaggyTone](https://github.com/litehacker/maggytone) and [MaggyBox](https://github.com/litehacker/maggybox). Those are C and C++ based projects working together. MaggyTone is a driver for a digital piano Casio 3200, which translates data bytes to Visuals. You may call the action as translating music into image. Well, at least he tried it to work that way. MaggyBox is more useful piece of software. It creates 3D printable piece of a music box called drum. The music played by the drum would be the music recorded on Casio 3200. It is like recording a music on a drum for a music box, to make a printable 3D model.   
In this repository, there should also be Angular Framework, ReactJS and React-Native components.
